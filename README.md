# The Monty Hall Problem
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

## Steps in game play
* setup the game
* user picks one of three doors
* monty opens one of the two remaining doors to reveal a goat
* user switches doors
* return win/lose outcome

## The Goal of this Exercise
The goal is to run the simulation 10,000 times and demonstrate that there is indeed a 2/3 chance of winning by switching your door choice vs a 1/3 chance of winning by keeping your original choice. Put these results in results.jpg and push the repo somewhere where we can review it.
